# Face Recognition Attendance



## Overview

Face recognition-based attendance system is a process of recognizing the faces of the students while taking attendance by using face bio-metrics based on high â€“ definition monitor video and other information technology. In our face recognition project, a computer system will be able to find and recognize human faces quickly and precisely in images or videos that are being captured through a webcam / surveillance camera. Here, faces will be recognized using face recognition algorithm.
